# computational geometry for origami

this is built to be the math engine for an origami library, but a lot of this is generally useful linear algebra and geometry.

## usage

include `geometry.js`

``` html
<script src="geometry.js"></script>
```

I sometimes have this built in either **umd** or **es** modules. you probably want **umd**. **es** is for including in modules. you can change this setting in `rollup.config.js`.

Build a module yourself: `rollup -c`
